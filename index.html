  <div class="container">
   <ul>
     <li><b>1879</b> - Born: March 14, 1879 Ulm Württemberg, Germany.</li>
     <li><b>1880</b> - In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.</li>
     <li><b>1892</b> - At the age of 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music), Einstein was introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: "At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.</li>
     <li><b>1895</b> - In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.</li>
     <li><b>1896</b> -  In September 1896 he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6. At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.</li>
     <li><b>1903</b> - Einstein and Marić married in January 1903.</li>
     <li><b>1904</b> - In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland. </li>
     <li><b>1910</b> - Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910. </li>
     <li><b>1914</b> - The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that, despite their close relationship before, Einstein's chief romantic attraction was now his cousin Elsa Löwenthal; she was his first cousin maternally and second cousin paternally</li>
     <li><b>1919</b> - Einstein and Marić divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.</li>
     <li><b>1886</b> - As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein agreed to give Marić any future (in the event, 1921) <b>Nobel Prize money. </b> </li>
     <li><b>1910</b> -  Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be." He spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for Marie.</li>
     <li><b>1919</b> - Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912</li>
     <li><b>1923</b> - In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam. In a volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006, Einstein described about six women, including Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to Elsa. Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who was married to the noted Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov (who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton).</li>
     <li><b>1933</b> - They emigrated to the United States in 1933. Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936"</li>
     <li><b>1955</b> - Died	18 April 1955 (aged 76)
        Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.</li>
  </ul>
    <h4 class="text-center"> Awards and honors</h4>
    <p class="text-center">Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.</p>
    
    <h5 class="text-center">“A man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be.” “Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.” “I believe in intuitions and inspirations. I sometimes feel that I am right."</h5>
